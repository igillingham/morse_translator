# morse_translator
Translate a file or stream of morse code to text and reverse.

The aim of the coding challenge is to produce 2 C++ applications, demonstrating an understanding of the following:
The first application would read in a plain text file from the local file structure and convert it to Morse Code (a text file using ".", "-" and space).
The second application reads the Morse Code file and outputs the original text.
A single object orientated implementation should be completed, with an appropriate test harness. In addition recommendations of improvements for a system translating significant quantities of morse code data to text should be provided.
